                    <p class="green lead">To start this is research, it is necessary and essential to start with a
                        definition of the word “drug”. From the Cambridge dictionary, the following definitions are
                        going to be exposed: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <ol class="green">1. “Any natural or artificially made chemical that is used as a medicine.”
                        </ol>
                        <ol class="green">2. “Any natural or artificially made chemical that is taken for pleasure, to
                            improve someone's
                            performance of an activity, or because a person cannot stop using it”</ol>
                        <ol class="green">3. “To give a person or animal a chemical that causes him, her, or it to lose
                            feeling or become
                            unconscious”.</ol>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="green"> From these definitions, the second one is the more adequate for the purpose of
                        this research. It
                        can further narrow down the term, defining “drugs” as: </p>
                    <p class="text-center green"> “Any natural or artificially made chemical that is taken for pleasure
                        or because a person cannot
                        stop using it.”</p>
                    <p class="green"> From this definition, the need arises to establish when this “substance that is
                        taken” becomes a
                        problem. If this definition is carefully analysed, the chemical substance doesn’t seem to be a
                        problem by itself, but the consequences for the user and for those who, not having used it, or
                        actively participated in the production, trafficking or any process related to this substance,
                        are caused a consequence related to the user or those who participated actively. </p>
                    <p class="green"> Thus, we will use the Scottish Government's official approach to this term. It is
                        said that the
                        official definitions focus the attention on the prolonged use of particular drugs. So, Scottish
                        Affair Committee (Problem drug use in Scotland, 2019), provides two brief definitions for
                        “drug-use problem”:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <ol class="green">1. From NHS Health Scotland: “use of opioids [...] and/or the illicit use of
                            benzodiazepines,
                            and implies routine and prolonged use as opposed to recreational and occasional drug use”.
                        </ol>
                        <ol class="green">2. Another definition: “use of any drug which is causing medical, social,
                            psychological,
                            physical, financial or legal problems”</ol>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="green"> Thus, for the purposes of this paper, a drug use problem will be defined as:
                        "undesirable
                        medical, social, psychological, physical, financial or legal consequences of long-term substance
                        use, both for the user and the non-user". Here it is necessary to emphasise that it is not only
                        those who use these substances on a long-term basis who suffer the consequences of their use,
                        taking into account the sphere surrounding the consumer, as it is the reason for this research
                        to analyse the policies followed by the Scottish government to alleviate these consequences.
                        Occasional use, usually called recreational use, is then ruled out.</p>
                    <p class="green"> Another question worth highlighting and analysing is what are the causes of these
                        behaviours
                        that trigger undesirable consequences and whether they are taken into account by the relevant
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p class="green"> In concluding this section, we will consider a number of substances that fall into
                        the category
                        of drugs that this research aims to analyse. Crew Scotland, a charity that attempts “to reduce
                        harm, challenge perceptions and help people make positive choices about their use of cannabis,
                        stimulant and other drugs”, lists a number of substances and their categories:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <ol class="green">1. Depressants: Alcohol, Benzodiazepines, Etizolam, GHB/GBL, Xanax
                            (alprazolam)
                        </ol>
                        <ol class="green"> 2. Cannabinoids: Cannabis, CBD</ol>
                        <ol class="green"> 3. Dissociatives: Ketamine, Nitrous Oxide</ol>
                        <ol class="green"> 4. Empathogens: MDMA (Ecstasy)</ol>
                        <ol class="green"> 5. Opioids: Fentanyl, Heroin, Naloxone</ol>
                        <ol class="green"> 6. Psychedelics: 2C family, DMT, LSD, Magic mushrooms</ol>
                        <ol class="green"> 7. Stimulants: Amphetamine (speed), Cocaine, Methamphetamine</ol>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="green"> However, for reasons explained below and in order not to make the research too
                        lengthy, only the
                        following substances will be considered for this investigation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="green">From depressants: Benzodiazepines</li>
                        <li class="green">Opioids</li>
                    </ul>
