                    <p class="green lead">Analysing the data published by the Scottish government statistics, two
                        observations can be made:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="green">The number of deaths has continued to rise, leaving Scotland in the lead in
                            the number of drug related deaths.
                        </li>
                        <li class="green">The data published to assess the effectiveness of Scottish government drug
                            policies are measured almost exclusively by the number of deaths.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="green">If one looks cautiously at the first of these observations, it is difficult not to
                        come to the disillusioning conclusion that the policies being pursued are not working for a
                        certain sector of society, those in the most deprived areas. However, it would be necessary to
                        observe the evolution of these policies over the years, and it is still too early to draw
                        conclusions in this respect.
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">Regarding the second observation, which for the purpose of this research is the
                        more crucial of the two, evaluating policies by focusing almost exclusively on the number of
                        drug-related deaths is limiting in any case: is, therefore, the only negative consequence of
                        heroin and benzodiazepine use and abuse the death for those who consume it?
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">The lack of information in this regard is striking. The fact that the information
                        published on "problem drug user" is not directly addressed and provided by the Scottish
                        government statistics suggests that an attempt is being made to omit a reality that goes beyond
                        death for the abuser of these substances (heroin and benzodiazepines). Thus, with just one visit
                        to Scotland's largest cities, any visitor or inhabitant of these places finds a reality in which
                        death is not yet present; and that is that the living conditions of people still alive and
                        addicted to these substances generate consequences both for themselves and for the rest of
                        society.
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">Yet this research only focuses on benzodiazepines and heroin, leaving aside the
                        wide range of other substances that fall under the term "drug". The conclusion for the purpose
                        of this research is that analysing the effectiveness of the policies carried out by focusing on
                        reducing the number of deaths is in any case limiting. This question invites us to consider that
                        the interest of the Scottish government seems to be "do what you want, but don't kill yourself".
                        Still, regardless of whether this liberal approach to heroin and benzodiazepines in particular,
                        and to any drug in general, is positive or negative, an effective policy would require the
                        collection, publication and consideration of much more data than just drug-related deaths.
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">Thus, questions such as the following would need to be considered:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="green">Number of users in the country and the substances they use.</li>
                        <li class="green">Analysis of patterns of use of the various substances.</li>
                        <li class="green">Analysing the consequences of use for the individual user and for society as a
                            whole.</li>
                        <li class="green">For those considered to be "problem drug users", more detailed knowledge of
                            the socio-
                            economic conditions of these users.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="green">Therefore, an adequate policy to reduce the problems related to drug use should
                        focus on the origins, before the negative consequences are generated, and not on the subsequent
                        consequence, which in this case is the death of an invalid who is already socially disqualified
                        and unable to live a life in coexistence with society, completely dependent on a substance whose
                        use becomes his primary objective.</p>
