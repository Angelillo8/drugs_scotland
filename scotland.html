                    <p class="green lead">According to the BBC (Clements, 2020), 1264 people died of drug misuse in
                        Scotland in 2019, that is 6% more than the previous year and more than double than 2014. That
                        represents the highest number since records began in 1996.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/chart1.png" alt="chart1" />

                    <p class="green">The article goes on to highlight the policies pursued by the UK and the Scottish
                        government. Thus, the Misuse of Drugs Act appears to be reserved for the UK parliament, while
                        the Scottish government advocates more control over regulation, to test initiatives such as
                        safer injecting facilities. It is worth noting that as an analysis of the issue, in this respect
                        both governments focus their efforts on alleviating deaths, not focusing on the causes of such
                        behaviours or the social consequences of such behaviours. Is the right approach to focus on
                        getting people to safely use a substance that has the consequence of driving that group into
                        destitution? These and similar questions will be discussed in the analysis of the issue below.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" green"> Continuing with the statement of facts, the European Drug Report
                        (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, 2020) presents the graphic
                        DRUG-INDUCED MORTALITY

                        RATES AMONG ADULTS (15-64). It is clear that Scotland leads by far in the number of deaths
                        related to drug misuse.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/chart2.png" alt="chart2" />
                    <p class="green">On the other hand, as the same report highlights (Drug-related deaths in Scotland,
                        2019, 2020), in 94% of all drug-related deaths, more than one substance was involved. Thus, the
                        substances in question are listed below with their respective number of deaths:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="green">Heroin and/or morphine: 645 deaths, more than in any previous year and 51% of
                            the total.</li>
                        <li class="green">Methadone: 560 deaths, the same as in 2018 (44%).</li>
                        <li class="green">One or more opioids (including heroin/morphine and methadone): 1,092 deaths,
                            more than in any previous year (86%).</li>
                        <li class="green">‘Street’ benzodiazepines (such as etizolam): 814 deaths, more than in any
                            previous
                            year (64%).</li>
                        <li class="green">‘Prescribable’ benzodiazepines (such as diazepam): 195 deaths, fewer than in
                            2017
                            and 2018 (15%).</li>
                        <li class="green">Gabapentin and/or pregabalin: 438 deaths, more than in any previous year
                            (35%).</li>
                        <li class="green">Cocaine: 365 deaths, more than in any previous year (29%).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="green">For its part, the European report indicates that in Scotland, the involvement of
                        various criminal groups in the large-scale manufacture and distribution of the previously
                        mentioned "street" benzodiazepines is part of the particular characteristics of the region on
                        which this research is focused, being implicated in 64% of the total number of deaths. The
                        Report states that “Typically made to look like 10-milligram diazepam tablets..., these often
                        contain new or uncontrolled benzodiazepines. Substances that pose a high risk of severe
                        poisoning have also occasionally been used, such as opioids and scopolamine.”

                    <p class="green lead text-center">Profile of the drug addict</p>
                    <p class="green">From the National Records of Scotland (National Records of Scotland, 2020), we can
                        extract the following profile of drug-related deaths:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="green">About 7 out of 10 people were men.</li>
                        <li class="green">More than two thirds were in the 35-54 age range.</li>
                        <li class="green">Three quarters of the deaths occurred in the following areas: 404 in Greater
                            Glasgow
                            & Clyde, 163 in Lanarkshire, 155 in Lothian, 118 in Tayside and 108 in Ayrshire & Arran.
                        </li>
                        <li class="green">More than half of the deaths involved the following substances: heroin and
                            morphine
                            (Opioids).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="green">After this brief summary provided by the report, it is considered necessary to
                        present the graphs also provided by the report, which will help to further narrow down the
                        profile of the user of these substances.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/chart3.png" alt="chart3" />
                    <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/chart4.png" alt="chart4" />
                    <p class="green">Both graphs present percentages of drug-related deaths per 1000 people. Although
                        the most striking age range is 35-44 years, all age ranges show increases in the percentage of
                        deaths. However, since the research is focused on the analysis of the policies carried out by
                        the Scottish government and already under the suspicion that the policies carried out by the
                        Scottish government are focused on the reduction of the number of deaths, it is also of interest
                        for the purpose of this research to present the following table, also offered by the National
                        Records of Scotland (Drug-related deaths in Scotland, 2019, 2020):</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/table1.png" alt="table1" />
                    <p class="green">The table was produced by the Information Services Division that belongs to the NHS
                        Scotland. (Prevalence of Problem Drug Use in Scotland, 2017). From this source it is important
                        to highlight the following aspects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="green">“The number of individuals with problem drug use in Scotland was estimated to
                            be in the range 55,800 to 58,900 during 2015/16. This represents an estimated prevalence
                            rate of approximately 1.62%.”</li>
                        <li class="green">“The majority of individuals with problem drug use were male (71%). The
                            prevalence rate amongst males was 2.35%, this compares to 0.92% for females.”</li>
                        <li class="green">“The rate of problem drug use amongst males and females was highest in the 25
                            to 34 years age group. The prevalence rates for males were higher than for females in each
                            age group. The rate for males aged 15 to 24 was more than four times higher than the
                            equivalent rate for females.”
                        </li>
                        <li class="green">“The highest regional rate was 1.99% in the West of Scotland compared to 1.37%
                            in the South & East, and 1.17% in the North. The estimates suggest that prevalence rates are
                            tending to be higher in the most populated areas of Scotland, which include large urban
                            areas.”</li>
                        <li class="green">“The latest national prevalence rate is lower than was observed for 2012/13.
                            However, due to some changes to the data included for this study and the margin of
                            uncertainty that surrounds the statistical models and assumptions, it is not possible to
                            conclude that a real reduction has occurred.”</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="green">Prevalence is defined by the same document as the total number of cases of the risk
                        factor in the population at a given time. So, the prevalence rate is the number of individuals
                        shown as a proportion of the overall population.</p>
                    <p class="green">Another chart worth displaying is the following:</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/chart5.png" alt="chart5" />
                    <p class="green">Where the Data Source for the estimation is taken from Clients registering with
                        specialist drug treatment services, Drug-related hospital admissions and Criminal Justice Social
                        Work (CJSW) reports. It is worth to notice that opioids represent approximately 94% of all the
                        persons receiving drug treatment and those admitted to hospital, compared to 82% identified by
                        CJSW, where benzodiazepines are in higher proportion.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/chart6.png" alt="chart6" />
                    <p class="green">From the previous chart, West of Scotland represents 60% of the overall drug
                        prevalence estimate for Scotland, despite of the lower overall proportion of Scottish population
                        aged 15 to 64 (49.0%). For the South & East of Scotland, 21.5% of the overall drug prevalence
                        estimate, and represents a similar proportion of the overall Scottish population aged 15 to 64
                        (25.3%). The North of Scotland makes up 18.5% but makes up a much larger proportion of the
                        overall Scottish population aged 15 to 64 (25.6%).</p>
                    <p class="green">Again, and for the sake of this research, some definitions are extracted from the
                        glossary of this document. The substances listed below will be described in a separate section.
                        Those will serve to further narrow down the profile of the problem drug user:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="green">Problem drug user: “the problematic use of opioids (including illicit and
                            prescribed methadone use) and/or the illicit use of benzodiazepines and implies routine and
                            prolonged use as opposed to recreational and occasional drug use.” (Prevalence of Problem
                            Drug Use in Scotland, 2017)</li>
                        <li class="green">Benzodiazepines: prescribed tranquilisers or anxiolytics and hypnotics (to
                            pro. Includes diazepam (Valium), lorazepam, librium, nitrazepam, temazepam.</li>
                        <li class="green">Opioid: opium or derivatives, used in medicine for inducing sleep and
                            relieving pain. Includes heroin (diamorphine), morphine, methadone, opium, codeine,
                            pethidine, dihydrocodeine (DF118).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="green">On the other hand, the article "Drug-related deaths in Scotland 1979-2013: evidence
                        of a vulnerable cohort of young men living in deprived areas" (Jane Parkinson, 2018) shows that
                        there is a considerable difference between drug-related deaths in the most deprived areas
                        compared to those cohorts from other areas; as the following chart shows (“Crude drug-related

                    <p class="green">Although the official stance of the Scottish government is not explicitly harm
                        reduction, certain issues such as the focussing the statistics of the drug situation in Scotland
                        on drug-related deaths and the funding of organisations such as the Scottish Drugs Forum, which
                        states as part of its vision "drugs-related harm cannot thrive" and part of its aims to "reduce
                        future and recurring problematic drug use", suggest that it is at least being advised to take
                        this approach.

                    <p class="green">Therefore, having an idea of what kind of policies harm reduction is, it is
                        necessary to dig a little deeper and define what "harm reduction" means. So, according to Harm
                        Reduction International (Harm Reduction International, 2021), harm reduction consists of
                        “policies, programmes and practices that aim to minimise negative health, social and legal
                        impacts associated with drug use, drug policies and drug laws”. The same website goes on to
                        state those practices and services for drug-related problems: "drug consumption rooms, needle
                        and syringe programmes, non-abstinence-based housing and employment initiatives, drug checking,
                        overdose prevention and reversal, psychosocial support, and the provision of information on
                        safer drug use."

                    <p class="green">Education and prevention seem to be one of the main approaches followed by the
                        Scottish Government for reducing the number of people with problem drug use in Scotland. This is
                        intended to emphasise prevention and early intervention for young people and those most at risk
                        of alcohol or drug addiction (Rights, respect and recovery: alcohol and drug treatment strategy,
                        2021). The main commitments include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="green">Identifying and implementing actions to reduce inequalities</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="green">Among the proposals to implement this strategy, the following stand out:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="green">Revise the programme of alcohol and drug use education in schools</li>
                        <li class="green">Early intervention for those at risk of developing problem drug use</li>
                        <li class="green">Develop guidance and resources that can provide accurate, evidence-based,
                            relevant
                            information around alcohol and drug use</li>

                    <p class="green">Established in July 2019 by the Minister for Public Health and Sport, the main goal
                        of the Drug Deaths Task Force is to tackle the rising number of drug deaths in Scotland and to
                        reduce the risk of harm, by implementing the following activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="green">Examine and publish evidence of the triggers of drug deaths</li>

                    <p class="green">This programme has been funded with £1 million, over 5 years from 2011 to 2016
                        (Scottish Government - Riaghaltas na h-Alba, 2021). Over forty-six thousand naloxone kits have
                        been supplied between 2011-2012 and 2017-2018.</p>
